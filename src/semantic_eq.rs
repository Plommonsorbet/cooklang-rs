//! Equality in meaning rather than in spelling
//!
//! [`PartialEq`] compares the parsed recipe as it was written. [`SemanticEq`]
//! compares what it means: `500 g` equals `0.5 kg`, `1 h` equals `60 min` and
//! `serves: 4` equals `servings: 4`.
//!
//! This needs a [`Converter`] to resolve units, so it cannot be a [`PartialEq`]
//! implementation.
